<div id="about">
  The self is inherently complex; we might assume that we know someone as a whole, but this is not always the case. Despite the numerous assumptions and judgements we see ourselves capable of making, a person’s “self” is more intricate than we often think. It takes time to accurately get to know a person because it takes time to put all the pieces of their “self” together. <br><br>Hence, this website metaphorically uses puzzles of human faces to convey this idea of the self. Users may realize that these puzzles (“selves”) are harder to solve and more time consuming than anticipated.
